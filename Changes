        * The Fribidi constants are now loaded via a separate module, 
          Text::Bidi::Constants
        * Switching to Dist::Zilla

2.03      2013-09-20 12:09:39 Asia/Jerusalem
        * More changes to Makefile.PL

2.02      2013-09-12
        * Fixed Makefile.PL
        
2.01      2013-09-11
        * Refactored Text::Bidi::Array::* to have a common base class 
          Text::Bidi::Array
        * Significantly improved the documentation of Text::Bidi::Array*
        * Fixed a bug in Text::Bidi::Array::Long --- now returns the correct 
          size
        * Added loading tests for Text::Bidi::Array*
        * Removed "no warnings 'experimental'", since this caused tests to 
          fail on older versions of perl.
        * Added information about the bidi extension for urxvt to the README 
          file

2.00      2013-09-10
        * Almost completely rewritten, mostly due to the changes in 
          libfribidi.  The interface has changed as well, so this version is 
          incompatible with the previous ones.

0.04      2008-02-07
        * Changed the build system to use ExtUtils::PkgConfig (if available), 
          to find the correct compilation flags (this is required since the 
          new version of libfribidi may need glib to build.)

0.03      2007-01-18
        * The PUSH macros caused some weird results, replaced with my own 
          macros
        * Apparently, Newx did not exist before 5.8.8, defined it if does not 
          exist

0.02      2007-01-17
        * Fixed memory leak in remove_bidi_marks when called with two 
          arguments
        * Fixed bug when calling log2vis with 2 arguments
        * Changed the typemaps to use more perlapi macros (XPUSH, etc.)

0.01      2006-08-28
        * First version
